# ğŸ“˜ Express.js Interview Questions â€“ Beginner to Intermediate

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide to **Express.js Interview Questions**. This document is designed to help you understand the core concepts of Express.js in **simple English**, with **real-world examples** and **developer tips**.

## âœ… 1. What is Express.js?

### âœ… Answer:
**Express.js** is a **web framework** built on top of **Node.js**. It simplifies the process of building servers and APIs by providing easy-to-use methods for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

Think of Express as the engine that helps you build websites and web services without writing a lot of repetitive code.

### ğŸ§  Example:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
````

### ğŸ’¡ Tips:

* Always start with `npm init` and install Express with `npm install express`
* Use `.listen()` to define the port your app should run on

## âœ… 2. What is Middleware in Express?

### âœ… Answer:

**Middleware** is a function that runs **between the request and the response**. It can modify the request, send a response, or pass control to the next function.

Middleware is used for:

* Logging
* Authentication
* Parsing data (like JSON)
* Error handling

### ğŸ§  Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request received at ${new Date()}`);
  next(); // Move to the next middleware or route
});
```

### ğŸ’¡ Tips:

* Don't forget to call `next()`, or the request will hang.
* Middleware order matters! It runs top to bottom.

## âœ… 3. What is Routing in Express?

### âœ… Answer:

**Routing** means defining how your app responds to client requests. You can define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URLs.

### ğŸ§  Example:

```js
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Us Page');
});
```

### ğŸ’¡ Tips:

* Use `app.get()` for reading data
* Use `app.post()` for submitting data
* Use `express.Router()` to separate routes into modules
